# Sprint Retrospectives

Facilitate effective retrospectives that drive continuous improvement through honest reflection and actionable commitments.

## When to Use This Skill

- End of each sprint
- Team improvement
- Process optimization
- Relationship building
- Learning from mistakes
- Celebrating success
- Identifying patterns
- Cultural development

## Core Concepts

### 1. Retrospective Formats

**Start-Stop-Continue**:
- Start: What should we begin doing?
- Stop: What should we stop doing?
- Continue: What's working well?

**Mad-Sad-Glad**:
- Mad: What frustrated us?
- Sad: What disappointed us?
- Glad: What made us happy?

**4Ls**:
- Liked: What went well?
- Learned: What did we discover?
- Lacked: What was missing?
- Longed for: What do we wish for?

**Sailboat**:
- Wind (helping): What's pushing us forward?
- Anchor (hindering): What's slowing us down?
- Island (goal): Where are we heading?
- Rocks (risks): What threats exist?

### 2. Retrospective Agenda (90 min)

```

### 3. Action Items

```markdown
