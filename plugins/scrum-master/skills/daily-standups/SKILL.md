# Daily Standups

Facilitate focused daily standups that synchronize the team, identify blockers, and maintain momentum toward sprint goals.

## When to Use This Skill

- Daily team synchronization
- Progress updates
- Impediment identification
- Re-planning work
- Maintaining focus
- Team alignment
- Quick problem-solving
- Building teamwork

## Core Concepts

### 1. Standard 3 Questions

1. What did I complete yesterday?
2. What will I work on today?
3. What blockers do I have?

### 2. Standup Format

**Time**: 15 minutes (time-boxed)
**When**: Same time daily
**Who**: Development team + Scrum Master (+ PO optional)
**Where**: Same location (physical or virtual)

**Structure**:
- Walk the board (task-focused)
- Round-robin (person-focused)
- Today's plan first (future-focused)

### 3. Walking the Board

```markdown
## Sprint Board Review

**To Do** → **In Progress** → **Done**

Story: User Login
├── Design mockup ✅ (Done)
├── API development 🔄 (Bob, blocked by auth library)
└── UI implementation 📋 (Alice, starting today)

Story: Password Reset
├── Email template ✅ (Done)
└── Backend logic 🔄 (Carol, testing today)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Stand up** - Literally stand (keeps it short)
2. **Time-box strictly** - 15 minutes maximum
3. **Focus on sprint goal** - Relevant updates only
4. **Identify blockers** - Resolve offline
5. **Same time, same place** - Consistency
6. **Everyone participates** - No observers
7. **Update taskboard** - Real-time visibility
8. **Park discussions** - Take detailed talks offline
