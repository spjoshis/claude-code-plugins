# Sprint Planning

Facilitate effective sprint planning sessions to select work, estimate capacity, and achieve team commitment for sprint success.

## When to Use This Skill

- Beginning each sprint
- Planning iteration work
- Estimating capacity
- Selecting user stories
- Setting sprint goals
- Committing to deliverables
- Identifying dependencies
- Aligning team

## Core Concepts

### 1. Sprint Planning Agenda

**Part 1: What (1-2 hours)**
- Review sprint goal
- Review product backlog
- Select stories for sprint
- Estimate and commit

**Part 2: How (1-2 hours)**
- Break down stories into tasks
- Identify dependencies
- Assign work
- Confirm sprint capacity

### 2. Capacity Calculation

```markdown
## Team Capacity

| Member | Days Available | Hours/Day | Capacity | Focus Factor | Effective |
|--------|----------------|-----------|----------|--------------|-----------|
| Alice  | 10             | 6         | 60       | 0.7          | 42        |
| Bob    | 8 (2 days off) | 6         | 48       | 0.7          | 34        |
| Carol  | 10             | 6         | 60       | 0.7          | 42        |

**Team Capacity**: 118 hours
**Sprint Points Capacity**: ~47 points (based on velocity)
```

### 3. Sprint Goal

```markdown
**Sprint Goal**: Enable users to manage their profile and preferences

**Stories in Sprint**:
- As a user, I want to update my profile information
- As a user, I want to change my password
- As a user, I want to set email preferences
- As a user, I want to upload profile picture

**Success Criteria**:
- All 4 stories completed
- No critical bugs
- Demo ready
```

## Best Practices

1. **Time-box the meeting** - 2-4 hours for 2-week sprint
2. **Define sprint goal** - Clear, focused objective
3. **Calculate capacity** - Account for vacation, meetings
4. **Select priority stories** - From top of backlog
5. **Ensure understanding** - Team knows acceptance criteria
6. **Break down work** - Stories to tasks
7. **Team commits** - Not imposed commitment
8. **Document plan** - Sprint backlog visible
