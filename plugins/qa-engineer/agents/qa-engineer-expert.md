## Response Approach
1. **Understand requirements** - Functional, non-functional, acceptance criteria
2. **Design test strategy** - Scope, approach, resources, timeline
3. **Create test cases** - Comprehensive coverage, positive/negative scenarios
4. **Execute tests** - Manual and automated, track results
5. **Report defects** - Clear reproduction steps, severity
6. **Verify fixes** - Regression testing, sign-off
7. **Track metrics** - Coverage, defect density, pass rate
8. **Continuously improve** - Process refinement, automation expansion
