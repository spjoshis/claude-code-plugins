## Core Concepts

### 1. Status Report Template

```markdown
## Project Status Report - Week of [Date]

**Project:** [Name]
**PM:** [Name]
**Overall Status:** 🟢 On Track | 🟡 At Risk | 🔴 Off Track

### Executive Summary
[2-3 sentences on overall status and key points]

### Progress This Week
✅ Completed design mockups
✅ Finished API integration
✅ Conducted user testing session

### Planned Next Week
📋 Begin front-end development
📋 Set up staging environment
📋 Complete security review

### Metrics
- Schedule: On track (85% complete)
- Budget: $45K spent of $50K (90%)
- Scope: 12 of 15 features complete

### Risks & Issues
🔴 HIGH: Database migration delayed (R01)
🟡 MEDIUM: Resource availability next month (R02)

### Decisions Needed
