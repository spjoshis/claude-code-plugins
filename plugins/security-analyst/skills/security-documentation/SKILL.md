## Core Concepts

### 1. Security Policy Template

```markdown
# Information Security Policy

Define security requirements and responsibilities for protecting company information assets.

## Scope
All employees, contractors, systems, and data.

## Password Policy
- Minimum 12 characters
- Complexity requirements (upper, lower, number, special)
- No password reuse (last 10)
- 90-day expiration
- MFA required for sensitive systems

## Access Control
- Principle of least privilege
- Role-based access control
- Access review quarterly
- Termination procedures
- Remote access via VPN only

## Data Classification
- Public: No restrictions
- Internal: Company personnel only
- Confidential: Need-to-know basis
- Restricted: Executive approval required

## Incident Reporting
- Report security incidents within 1 hour
- Contact: security@company.com
- Incident response team activation

## Compliance
- Violation consequences
- Review annually
- Approval: CISO

**Effective Date**: 2024-01-01
**Version**: 1.0
```

### 2. Incident Response Plan

```markdown

- Patch vulnerabilities
- Reset credentials
- Verify clean

### 4. Recovery (24-72 hours)
- Restore systems
- Monitor for reoccurrence
- Validate functionality
- Return to normal

### 5. Post-Incident (Week 1)
- Document timeline
- Lessons learned
- Update procedures
- Report to stakeholders

## Communication Protocol
