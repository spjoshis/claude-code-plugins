# Prototyping

Build interactive prototypes that simulate real product behavior for testing and stakeholder demonstrations.

## When to Use This Skill

- Usability testing
- Stakeholder demos
- Developer handoff
- User flow validation
- Animation testing
- Interaction design
- Concept validation
- Investor presentations

## Core Concepts

### 1. Prototype Fidelity Levels

**Low-Fidelity**:
- Paper prototypes
- Clickable wireframes
- Basic navigation
- Fast iteration

**Medium-Fidelity**:
- Interactive wireframes
- Some content
- Basic interactions
- User flow testing

**High-Fidelity**:
- Visual design applied
- Real content
- Animations
- Full interactions
- Near-production quality

### 2. Figma Prototype Setup

```markdown
## Prototype Configuration

**Device**: iPhone 14 Pro (393x852)
**Starting Frame**: Homepage

**Interactions**:
1. Homepage → Product Page
   - Trigger: Click on product card
   - Action: Navigate to
   - Animation: Slide left
   - Duration: 300ms
   - Easing: Ease out

2. Add to Cart Button
   - Trigger: Click
   - Action: Change to "Added!"
   - Animation: None
   - Reset after: 2s

3. Navigation Menu
   - Trigger: Click hamburger icon
   - Action: Overlay menu
   - Animation: Slide in from left
   - Duration: 250ms

4. Form Field Focus
   - Trigger: Focus
   - Action: Change to focus state
   - Animation: None
```

## Best Practices

1. **Define purpose** - Testing vs presentation
2. **Match fidelity** - To stage of design
3. **Use real content** - Authentic scenarios
4. **Limit flows** - Focus on key tasks
5. **Include states** - Loading, error, success
6. **Test interactions** - Before user testing
7. **Document flows** - Clear navigation map
8. **Gather feedback** - Iterate based on testing
